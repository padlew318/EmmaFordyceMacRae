          <p>Emma Fordyce MacRae also scraped the paint which flattened the brushstrokes. Unlike other artists most of her paintings are not varnished. Sometimes she also treated discrete parts of the
          compositions with an additional layer of thin paint as in the hair of the woman on the right in <i>Before the Song</i> in which a lighter tone has been applied on top of the rich rust
          color.</p>
