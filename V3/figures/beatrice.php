          <p>In Beatrice, the rich pattern of the sitter's blue and red dress and her copper hair are set against a muted palette of olives and browns. There may
            or may not be an underlying theme here relating to Italy or Italian history as the domed
            structure visible through the window in the background resembles the church of Santa
            Maria della Salute in Venice (which MacRae also painted), and makes a connection to the
            Madonna sculpture. Beatrice's name is associated with the Renaissance; she was the
            Beatrice beloved of the poet Dante. Even the anemones in the bowl grow wild in the
            fields outside Rome. As one critic wrote about this painting, "It is possible to distinguish
            a relation to the great Perugino, Raphael's master." 18 At the same time, though, Beatrice's
            dress and hairstyle put her in the twentieth century. Rather than giving the composition a
            dated feeling, however, this back and forth between the contemporary and the historic
            again creates timelessness in Emma Fordyce MacRae's work.</p>
