        <p>Emma Fordyce MacRae's more typical approach was to condense the space in her still lifes, bringing foreground and background together and making
            the specific identification of the place irrelevant. For backgrounds, she mostly used wallpaper and textiles in a variety of historic styles or even, occasionally, another
            work of art as in <i>Zinnias with Vermeer Print</i>.</p>
