        <p>Sometimes, especially in her later work, Emma Fordyce MacRae chose a plain background in a strong or neutral tone as seen <i>Tulips in Hopi Pot</i> 
        and <a href="http://www.emmafordycemacrae.com/flowers/dogwood_with_madonna.html"><i>Dogwood</i></a>, the colors of the backgrounds either echoed the palette of the flowers 
        or contrasted to them and MacRae usually featured a single type of flower.</p>

        <p>These settings drew positive responses for MacRae's work; one reviewer noted "she has used figured backgrounds behind her flowers daringly but with pleasing effect".</p>
