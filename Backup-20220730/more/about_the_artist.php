              <p> <strong>Emma Fordyce MacRae, N.A.</strong> (April 27,1887 - August 6, 1974) was an American painter with a distinctive style achieved by purposefully scraping back the paint, sometimes back to the ground on the canvas, to allow areas of the color below to show through. </p>
              
              <p> MacRae enrolled at the Art Students League in 1911, studying first with Frank Vincent DuMond and Kenneth Hayes Miller, and later, beginning in 1915, with Luis Mora, Ernest Blumenschein, and John Sloan. She also attended one of Robert Reid's summer courses. </p>
