<p><strong>Emma Fordyce MacRae, N.A.</strong> (b. April 27,1887 in Vienna - d. August 6, 1974) was an American representational painter with a distinctive style achieved by purposefully scraping back the paint, sometimes back to the ground on the canvas, to allow areas of the color below to show through.  This chalky, mottled appearance produced a sense of age in her compositions likened by one critic to &quot;the spots from which the color has fallen off&quot; of old murals. </p>

<p>MacRae enrolled at the Art Students League in 1911, studying first with Frank Vincent DuMond and Kenneth Hayes Miller, and later, beginning in 1915, with Luis Mora, Ernest Blumenschein, and John Sloan. She also attended one of Robert Reid&#39;s summer courses.</p>
