<p>The theme of women in interiors has a long history and in the twentieth century was mostly associated with academic painters, especially the artists of the Boston School.</p>

<p>Emma Fordyce MacRae's friend Ivan Olinsky also treated this subject, but also with a more traditional approach. MacRae's paintings differ, however, in
their style from either his work or those artists of the Boston School in that hers "suggest a
simplification of form not unlike that practiced by many a modern sculptor." This
treatment is seen, for example, in the planes of the face and neck of the sitter in this 
painting of Olinsky's daughter.</p>
