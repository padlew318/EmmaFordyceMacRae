<p>In her figurative work, Emma Fordyce MacRae wove a complex relationship between the sitter(s) and the setting in which wallpaper, a view through a window, a mirror, a painting, a clock,
or a print are displayed. As with the variety of textiles and wallpapers in her still lifes.</p>

<p>MacRae often made references to the past or other cultures by including Japanese or Dutch prints or even a Renaissance painting.</p>

<p>Color unifies the composition of Nanette Theodore in <i>Distant Mountains</i> this is achieved with a more subdued palette, but the pale green of the figure's garment echoes the
groundcover in the valley viewed through the window. The pink on her fingernails is picked up in the same field. MacRae carefully modeled the bodies of her figures, yet
also subtly outlines them, creating a quiet tension between the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional.</p>
