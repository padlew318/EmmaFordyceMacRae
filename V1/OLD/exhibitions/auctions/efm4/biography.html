        <p>Emma Fordyce MacRae established her subjects – landscapes, still lifes and landscapes – early in her career and by the late 1910's or early 1920's had evolved her own style. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Born in Vienna in 1887 of American parents who returned to New York City MacRae enrolled at the Art Students League in 1911 after apparently refusing to join her husband who left New York to go West.  MacRae studied with Frank Vincent DuMond, Kenneth Hayes Miller, Luis Mora, Ernest Blumenschein and John Sloan and attended a summer course with Robert Reid. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p> In her youth MacRae travelled annually to Europe.  While her father Dr Fordyce spoke before medical societies the family visited museums and galleries and no doubt these European travels influenced her as well as her studies. Arthur Dow's book on composition which was in her library may have also encouraged her judicious placements of objects and use of color in her paintings. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>MacRae opened her studio at 12 West 69th Street in New York and exhibited in December 1914 at the Anderson Gallery.   Later MacRae opened a summer studio in Gloucester, Massachusetts and her choice of subjects distanced her from what was then being produced by painters on Cape Ann preferring as she did for her landscapes the stretch of beaches and coves along Ipswich Bay such as <em>Rockport Beach</em> and <em>August in New England</em> as well as the views from her garden and the flowers themselves.</p>
