<p>Following the successful exhibition at the Anderson Galleries in 1914 in New York MacRae continued to exhibit landscape paintings of Cape Ann.  At the City Art Museum in St. Louis, Goupil and Co of Paris in 1917, Italian Fishing Boats at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1918 and other galleries until 1961.</p>

<p>MacRae often came to Pigeon Cove harbor.  A large warehouse built at the entrance after MacRae left obscuring the view of the harbor was torn down in around 2008 and today two fishermen’s huts on the dock with the granite blocks piled high behind them remain and can be seen in her Fishermen at Pigeon Cove painted in the evening with the boats returning at low tide.   MacRae set up her easel on the dock and the landscape looks back along the dock and includes boats, the two fishermen’s huts and the house without the widow’s walk which can be seen today.</p>

<p>From her years at art school Emma learned a love of the mechanics of painting, the importance of preparing a canvas or board for oil painting, the choice of texture and the role of the brush and palette knife.  In Fishermen at Pigeon Cove Emma’s reflections in the water reflect the sky and the under painting is a yellow tone with other colors built up with a brush or palette knife one on top of another to create the depth and dimension of what seems at first glance to be a twilight tranquil scene but which is, in fact, bustling with activity.  In this landscape painting once again can be seen the white under painting used to good effect to highlight around roofs and people and even the stones forming the dock.   These areas where MacRae has taken back the paint to an under paint have been mistaken by some as areas of paint loss rather than a deliberate act by the artist.</p>
